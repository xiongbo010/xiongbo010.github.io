My research lies at the intersection of **neural and symbolic AI**, integrating advances in **deep learning** and **foundation models** with symbolic **knowledge representations** including **knowledge graphs** and **ontologies**. I develop AI systems that are not only powerful in prediction but also **reliable**, **interpretable**, and **robustly generalizable**, ensuring that they can be trusted in high-stakes domains such as **biomedicine and healthcare**.


To achieve this, I conduct fundamental research in the following areas:

---

### Knowledge-enhanced LLMs/foundation models

**Integrating knowledge with large language models** to improve their reliability, interpretability, factual accuracy, or generalization ability
<br>*Representative work: [ICLR'25](), [EMNLP'25](), [NAACL'25](), [EMNLP'24](), [NeSy'25]()*

**Foundation models for structured data** -- Developing generalizeble models for structured data
<br>*Representative work: [EMNLP'25](), [ICML'25]()*

### Representation learning with data & knowledge structures

**Learning on graph-structured data** — Developing methods for learning from graph-structured information, including knowledge graphs and ontologies.
<br>*Representative work: [ICML'25](), [WWW'25](), [NeurIPS'22a](), [ACL'23](), [AAAI'24](), [CIKM'24](), [KDD'22]()*

**Semantic web and ontologies** — Working with description logic and ontology reasoning for structured knowledge representation.
<br>*Representative work: [ISWC'22](link), [ISWC'23](link)*

**Geometric representation learning** — Exploiting data geometry (hyperbolic, pseudo-Riemannian spaces) to improve machine learning on hierarchical and complex-structured data.
<br>*Representative work: [NeurIPS'22a](), [NeurIPS'22b](), [KDD'22]()*
