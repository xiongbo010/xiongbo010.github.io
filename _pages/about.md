I am a [Postdoctoral Scholar](https://profiles.stanford.edu/352663) in AI at [Stanford University](), under the supervision of [Prof. Mark Musen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FmMT4CcAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I received my Ph.D. in computer science (with summa cum laude) at the [University of Stuttgart](), Germany and the [Intl. Max Plank Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS)](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/), under the supervision of [Prof. Steffen Staab](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5xf8n2/professor-steffen-staab). 
During my PhD, I was funded by the [Marie Skłodowska-Curie PhD Fellowship]() and was an associate member of the [TrustAGI Lab](https://trust-agi.github.io/) advised by [Prof. Shirui Pan](). I have published 20+ papers and/or served as PC in premier AI conferences such as NeurIPS, KDD, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, WWW, SIGIR, AAAI, ECAI, ISWC, etc., and was the first-author recipient of the Best Student Paper Award of ISWC'22. 

I conduct research in AI and ML with a special emphasis on advancing the **representation** of human knowledge. In particular, I explore two core paradigms of knowledge representation:
<br>
1) **Symbolic representation**: Knowledge graphs, ontology, logic, web, etc. 
<br>
2) **Neural representation**: Large language models, graph embeddings. 

By bridging these two forms of representations (neuro-symbolic), I aim to develop **reliable** and **interpretable** AI systems allowing for learning, reasoning, and adapting into real domains.
